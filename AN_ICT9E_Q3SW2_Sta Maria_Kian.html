				       This movie is a thriller but it has some morals you can learn like showing your bond with your friends and that you should never leave them in times when life hits you rock bottom. Another thing ive learned here it you have to fight for your freedom and right. Nevetheless, it was an amazing movie and i recommend it for sure!<br>

				       <span style="color: #887DAA;">Movie Review:</span>This movie was sad but awesome!<br>
				       This movie was a sad one and i had a lot of tears sacrificed for this one. Their are scenes when you just wanna cry and smile at the same time, but what really made me sad was the cliffhanger ending because it didnt end the happy and right way.<br>
